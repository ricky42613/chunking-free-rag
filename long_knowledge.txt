This week, the most significant news in the IT and cybersecurity world is the accidental discovery of a backdoor planted in XZ/liblzma. Red Hat also announced a related vulnerability, CVE-2024--3094, with several news articles related to this incident. Fortunately, this hidden backdoor was discovered early, and currently, only some Linux versions are affected, with the impact not being too widespread. However, this supply chain attack targeting open-source software is still under investigation and discussion.\n\nNot only the accidental discovery process but also the method of implanting the backdoor has surprised various sectors. The GitHub account involved in this incident had been created in 2021 and 2022, gradually gaining the trust of the original XZ maintainers. This infiltration process has attracted significant attention and has once again sparked discussions on the security of open-source software.\n\nTwo other Linux vulnerabilities worth noting are Flipping Pages, involving the netfilter component, and WallEscape, involving the util-linux package. The patches for these vulnerabilities were released at the end of January and March, respectively. Recently, researchers have disclosed the details and exploitation scenarios of these vulnerabilities, urging users who have not yet updated to do so as soon as possible.\n\nIn other vulnerability exploitation news, organizations using the AI framework Ray should pay special attention. At the end of November last year, Anyscale disclosed five vulnerabilities, but only CVE-2023-48022 was not patched, even being deemed not a vulnerability. However, cybersecurity firms have now revealed attack activities exploiting this vulnerability, known as ShadowRay.\n\nGoogle Pixel users should also be cautious. In the Android April security update announcement, two Pixel information leakage vulnerabilities showed signs of being exploited, CVE-2024-29745 and CVE-2024-29748, which were not mentioned in this issue's cybersecurity daily but are included here.\n\nIn recent cybersecurity events, two news items we believe are worth paying attention to occurred at the United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the non-profit organization OWASP Foundation. We summarize them as follows:\n- The US CISA was also affected by an Ivanti system vulnerability at the beginning of the year. Hackers targeted the US federal high-risk chemical critical infrastructure, infiltrating the Chemical Security Assessment Tool (CSAT) provided by CISA and successfully deploying a Web Shell. Another key infrastructure cybersecurity information tool, CISA Gateway, was also affected.\n- The OWASP Foundation, well-known for publishing the top ten web application security risks, recently issued a data breach notification. Member resume files from 2006 to 2014 may have been leaked due to a configuration issue on an old Wiki web server.\n\nAdditionally, a hacking incident involving the school administration systems of seven high schools occurred domestically. We believe two issues are worth noting and cautioning. One concerns the target of the hacker's ransom, which was not these schools but the company that developed the school administration system, Yaxin Information. The other issue is the problem of using generic account passwords. The investigation found that hackers first infiltrated the system of one school, obtaining the login credentials for that school's system. However, using the same set of account passwords, hackers could also successfully log into the systems of the other six schools.\n\n[April 1] A supply chain attack that had been lurking for three years was discovered, with the XZ Utils library recently implanted with a backdoor. The revelation of this supply chain attack over the weekend shocked the entire cybersecurity community and kept the IT world busy with patching. Attackers targeted the XZ Utils data compression library to implant a backdoor, which would allow attackers to bypass the SSHD authentication mechanism and is quite difficult to detect.\n\nFortunately, researchers discovered this due to investigating a situation where SSH login failed and login slowed down by 500 milliseconds. However, looking back at the malicious GitHub account submission, it was registered in 2021 and began tentatively submitting commits to the XZ library in February 2022.\n\n[April 2] CISA reported to the US government about an Ivanti system intrusion incident. At the beginning of this year, Ivanti announced a series of Connect Secure and Policy Secure vulnerabilities, once again shocking the global cybersecurity community. Researchers have continuously discovered related attack activities, but so far, few corporate organizations have confirmed being attacked, leaving it uncertain whether to be relieved or worried about potential consequences.\n\nBy early March, it was reported that Ivanti servers belonging to the United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) had been invaded, resulting in two systems being hacked, confirming the impact of the aforementioned vulnerabilities. At the end of March, the agency also reported the details of this incident to several government agencies.\n\n[April 3] Researchers discovered that a group under the Chinese hacker organization APT41 is using more covert methods to evade detection. In recent years, attack activities by the Chinese hacker organization APT41 have been reported from time to time, but few related incidents were disclosed at the beginning of this year. Recently, researchers discovered the attack methods of a group under this organization.\n\nCybersecurity firm Trend Micro discovered that the group, Earth Freybug, specifically targets endpoint protection systems (note: the researchers probably refer to EDR-related systems) to track malicious actions, attempting to make these systems unable to detect their movements.
